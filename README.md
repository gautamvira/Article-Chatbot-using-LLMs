# PaperBot AI
PaperBot AI is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to answer questions about scholarly articles. It utilizes local language models and embeddings for efficient, context-aware responses. The system is powered by Ollama for LLMs and embeddings, with ChromaDB handling vector storage and retrieval.

## Features
- **RAG-based architecture**: Combines retrieval and generation for highly relevant and accurate responses.
- **Local processing**: Runs language models and embeddings locally using Ollama.
- **Vector search**: Efficient vector storage and retrieval with ChromaDB for high-quality responses based on user queries.

 Note: Due to copyright restrictions, the scholarly articles used for this project must be provided by the user. You will need to upload your own articles to the system to enable the bot to answer queries effectively.
